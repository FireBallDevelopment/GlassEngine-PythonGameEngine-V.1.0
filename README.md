# Glass.PY-Python-OpenSource-Library

## Why you need to use Glass.PY:

It's simple beacause, it's a library that simplify's more the python Languaje than it is... really, you don't have any reason to say no to learn python with this library!

Some things like developing a simple **Youtube API** interaction it's so easy... that in 5 simple lines of code you can create a Youtube comment randomizer for some, you know?, thing... but you are thinking, -- I'm not a **Youtuber** that makes Giveaways every 1 suscriber --

But one can do a simple hello world with only writing:
```python
import glass.py

glass.hello()

```

Ok, this was something stupid, but, if you don't want to write:
```python

print("Hello World!")

```

But now, its in early development so, you cant do something incredible, but in some weeks im going to relase a more worked version! sooooo... goodbye!
